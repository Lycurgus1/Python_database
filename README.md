# What is this?

This is a collection of notes and theory regarding working with databases in python, as part of DevOps training at Sparta Global

## What does it contain?

- This contains the base notes about database connections (database_connections)

- This is then followed by OOP_databases and main.py which show the use of databases along with OOP principles

- Main calls functions from OOP_databases

- These functions use the principles of dry, each one doing a specific repeatable task so it is not repeated. 

- See theory.md for a breakdown of the theory
